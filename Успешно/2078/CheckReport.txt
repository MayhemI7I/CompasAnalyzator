 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1747917475 (0x00000000682F1AA3)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -159 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFF61)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = -19/4016
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = -19/4016
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
