 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1748238992 (0x0000000068340290)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -14 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF2)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = -2/1600
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = -2/1600
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
