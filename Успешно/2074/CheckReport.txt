 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1747746428 (0x00000000682C7E7C)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -15 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF1)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = -2/3376
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = -2/3376
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
