From the RCR:
 - SyncTimePOSIX  [ RCR          ] = 1747999597 (0x0000000068305B6D)
 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1748000082 (0x0000000068305D52)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -1 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = 0/485
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = 0/485
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
