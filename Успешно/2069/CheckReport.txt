 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1747984379 (0x0000000068301FFB)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -265 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFEF7)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = -32/4804
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = -32/4804
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
