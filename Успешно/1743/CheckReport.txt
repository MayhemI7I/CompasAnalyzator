From the RCR:
 - SyncTimePOSIX  [ RCR          ] = 1748003319 (0x00000000683069F7)
 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1748004037 (0x0000000068306CC5)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -18 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEE)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = -2/718
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = -2/718
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
