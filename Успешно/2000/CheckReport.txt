From the RCR:
 - SyncTimePOSIX  [ RCR          ] = 1747112840 (0x000000006822D388)
 - CheckTimePOSIX [ RCR          ] = 1747115219 (0x000000006822DCD3)
 - Drift          [ RCR          ] = -137 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFF77)
 - UTCGPSDiffSync [ RCR          ] = 18 (0x0000000000000012)

The RCR data has been used for drift calculations
Calculated drift (us/s) = -17/2379
UTC-GPS difference from the RCR data: normal

Processing results: 
Calculated drift (us/s) = -17/2379
The UTC-GPS difference (s) = 18
